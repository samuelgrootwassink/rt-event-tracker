# Introduction

snscrape is a Python module for scraping data from various social media platforms. It provides a flexible and efficient way of collecting data from sites like Twitter and Reddit, and it can be used both as a Command Line Interface (CLI) or as a library. In this documentation, we will focus on the use of snscrape as a library.
Installation

To install snscrape, you can use the following pip command:

```
pip install snscrape
```

Twitter Scraping

To scrape data from Twitter, you will need to use the TwitterScraper class. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
from snscrape.modules import twitter
```

## Create an instance of the TwitterScraper class

```
scraper = twitter.TwitterScraper()
```

### Define the parameters for the query

```
query = {
    "query": "python",
    "max_results": 100
}
```

### Run the query

```
for tweet in scraper.search(query):
    print(tweet)
```

The query parameter should be a dictionary that specifies the search terms and other options. The search method returns an iterator that yields the tweets that match the query.

The following options are available for the query dictionary:

```
    query: A string that specifies the search terms.
    max_results: An integer that specifies the maximum number of results to return.
    lang: A string that specifies the language of the tweets to return.
    since_id: A string or integer that specifies the minimum tweet ID to include in the results.
    max_id: A string or integer that specifies the maximum tweet ID to include in the results.
    until: A string that specifies the maximum date to include in the results. The format should be YYYY-MM-DD.
    since: A string that specifies the minimum date to include in the results. The format should be YYYY-MM-DD.
    geocode: A string that specifies the latitude, longitude, and radius to search within. The format should be latitude,longitude,radius, where radius is in kilometers.
```

## Reddit Scraping

To scrape data from Reddit, you will need to use the RedditScraper class. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
from snscrape.modules import reddit
```

### Create an instance of the RedditScraper class
scraper = reddit.RedditScraper()

### Define the parameters for the query

```
query = {
    "query": "python",
    "limit": 100
}
```

### Run the query

```
for submission in scraper.search(query):
    print(submission)
```

The query parameter should be a dictionary that specifies the search terms and other options. The search method returns an iterator that yields the submissions that match the query.

The following options are available for the query dictionary:

```
    query: A string that specifies the search terms.
    limit: An integer that specifies the maximum number of results to return.
    sort: A string that specifies the sort order of the results. The options are relevance, hot, top, new, and comments.
